#Chinese Segmentation Algorithm

##Summary
    Chinese sentence is hard to split into words because there is not any blanks. 
    
    There are some chinese segmentation algorithm models. This article is going to introduct HMM model which 
    
    is used in chinese segmentation.
##HMM
    HMM is short for hidden markov model. It is usually used to solve 3 problems, one of these is calculation of 
    
    hidden state chain. Chinese segmentation algorithm is based on calculation of hidden state chain.
